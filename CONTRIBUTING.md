# How to contribute

### Getting Started
In order to contribute, you will need to install VariantValidator. Please see our 
[Installation manual](https://github.com/openvar/variantValidator/blob/master/docs/INSTALLATION.md) and pay attention the **Developers** section

Once you have installed VariantValidator and the necessary databases, checkout the `develop` branch and create your own working branch from there. 
***Do not create working branches from `Master`. All pull requests into master will be refused.***

### Planning and execution
VariantValidator is a community driven tool. Everything we build attempts to serve a community need and we work with the community to ensure all our 
resources sufficiently funtional and suitable. Before you develop new code, please open an [Issue](https://github.com/openvar/variantValidator/issues) 
so users can be invited to contribute to the design and "sign-off" on your work. Additional guidance regarding contributions will also be provided in the issue.

### Build unit tests
We use continuous integration. Please ensure you add test files to out [unit-tests](https://github.com/openvar/variantValidator/tree/master/tests). 
Guidance and assistance will be provided in the Issue you opened

### Pushing your code
Once you have completed your code, please commit to your working branch. Provide a link to the commit in the Issue you opened and close the issue so Admin will be 
aware that you are finished. We will then work with you to merge the code into develop and ultimately into the master branch.
