Information in the Ensembl_reference_dict is from Ensembl, available at the following URL:
https://m.ensembl.org/info/genome/variation/prediction/predicted_data.html
The information is the same as the output for sequence ontology terms from the 
Ensembl VEP API

This module assigns sequence ontology terms based on the variant nomenclature. 
v1 - Currently will assign stop_loss, stop_gain, start_loss, missense and
synonymous variants based on a correctly HVGS-formatted protein variant description.

This module has been tested with a string input, and with data obtained from the 
Variant Validator API.

"""
The code below obtains an input protein variant by querying the Variant Validator API
This can also be replaced with a prompt for a string:
    
variant_accession = input("Please input a RefSeq protein variant: ")
variant_accession = str(variant_accession)

For future integration, this code (end of code section indicated by another long 
comment) should be updated to handle the input object
